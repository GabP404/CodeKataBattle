\section{Purpose}

The purpose of the project CodeKataBattle (CKB) is to develop a platform where Students can practice coding together. Educators set up challenges (called Battles) within Tournaments, and Students work in teams to solve them. The platform checks their code automatically, giving scores based on how well it works, how quickly they finish, and how good their code quality is. Educators may optionally give extra scores by checking the work themselves, in a so-called Consolidation Stage which starts right after the end of every Battle. Students get ranked in Tournaments based on their scores obtained in teams, and can earn Badges for some achievements, in order to make learning programming more fun and competitive.

\subsection{Goals}

{\color{bluepoli}\rule{\linewidth}{0.1pt}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[\textcolor{bluepoli}{G1}] Allows registered Students who enrolled according to the right modalities to participate in a Tournament of Code Kata Battles and take part in its Battles.
    \item[\textcolor{bluepoli}{G2}] Allows registered Educators to manage Tournaments for which they have been granted permission.
    \item[\textcolor{bluepoli}{G3}] Allows registered Students who participate in a Tournament of Code Kata Battles to be rewarded of different achievements.
    \item[\textcolor{bluepoli}{G4}] Allows registered Users to visualize information for which they have granted permission.
    \item[\textcolor{bluepoli}{G5}] Automates code evaluation process using GitHub Actions and some static analysis tools.
\end{enumerate}

{\color{bluepoli}\rule{\linewidth}{0.1pt}}

\section{Scope}

The main features which should be provided in order to achieve the aim of the project are:

\item \textcolor{bluepoli}{Creating Challenges:} Educators can make coding challenges (Battles) that Students can join, alone or in teams (groups), within the context of a Tournament.

\item \textcolor{bluepoli}{Using GitHub Actions for Code Submsissions:} Students are supposed to submit their code for a Battle in their GitHub repository, and the system must be informed of a new commit by a participating Student making use of GitHub Actions.

\item \textcolor{bluepoli}{Checking Code both Automatically and Manually:} The platform assigns a score to Students' code automatically, without the intervention of any Educator. Optionally, Educators may also decide to evaluate the code themselves.

\item \textcolor{bluepoli}{Rankings:} During each Battle, a live ranking of the involved teams is available, enabling participating Students to track their performance. Additionally, live Tournament rankings show how well each Student is performing in the Battles within a given Tournament.

\item \textcolor{bluepoli}{Badges for Achievements:} At the end of every Tournament, Students who achieved good results may be awarded with a special Badges, which are ruled by the Educator who created the Tournament.

The main goal is to help Students practice coding, giving them feedback and comparing their results to others.

\subsection{Definitions}

{\color{bluepoli}\rule{\linewidth}{0.1pt}}

\item \textcolor{bluepoli}{Battle:} A Code Kata, that is, a challenge in which teams of players need to solve a problem in a specific coding language and submit their code to get a score according to the rules of the Battle.
\item \textcolor{bluepoli}{Tournament:} A competition composed of many Battles in which participants' overall score is the sum of all the scores obtained in every Battle they participated in, individually or in team with other players.
\item \textcolor{bluepoli}{Student:} The User which takes part into the Tournaments of Battles.
\item \textcolor{bluepoli}{Educator:} The User which organizes Tournaments of Battles to which the Students can participate and who manages every aspect about them.
\item \textcolor{bluepoli}{Consolidation stage:} The Consolidation Stage is the phase of a Battle which starts as soon as the submission deadline expires, during which the Educators who manage the Tournament can eventually assign an additional score to every team, which will be summed to the score previously assigned by the platform.
\item \textcolor{bluepoli}{Badge:} A Badge is an achievement marker related to a certain Tournament, obtained by Students if they satisfied the specific conditions defined by the Educator during the creation process of the Tournament.
